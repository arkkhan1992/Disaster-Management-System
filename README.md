Disaster Management System 
 
Natural Disasters have threatened mankind since history started. Due to geographic location and environment change, there are many vulnerable countries to natural disasters. The countries also lacks effective disaster preparedness system to confront natural disasters. In addition, a tourist may face difficulties in finding safe area or shelter place prior to the occurrence of natural disasters. For this reason, we have proposed a disaster management system and evacuation system for people. 
 
PROPOSED SYSTEM 
 
Our proposed location based disaster preparedness system consists of a GPS supported android mobile phones with our proposed application installed on it and users registered on it. The user of our proposed android application can also register the number of family members, relative, friends to send message for help. Through network provider or GPS provider, mobile phone gets the current location of its user and sends it to register member by the user in its application. Using this current position the user of our proposed application message.
